# DiscogsRecordLabeler
python script for crawling your discogs library via API and discogs_client module for python - generating printable 8163 shipping labels for your printer@home.

Uses multiple python modules for downloading the matching youtube videos, music analysation, bpm and key analysation. 

- pdfLaTeX, ffmpeg and gnuplot are used as subprocesses
- works on linux, not tested on other platforms, should be easy to get running on any Unix system
- some adjustment needed for the pdf output, still some formatting problems there as you can see in the image below
