# DiscogsRecordLabeler
This Python script is designed for crawling your Discogs library using the Discogs API and the discogs_client module for Python. It generates printable 8163 shipping labels for your home printer.

The script utilizes various Python modules for tasks such as matching and downloading YouTube videos, music analysis, and BPM and key analysis.

The following subprocesses are employed: pdfLaTeX, ffmpeg, and gnuplot.

It is compatible with Linux and has not been tested on other platforms, but it should be straightforward to set up on any Unix system.

Some adjustments may be necessary for the PDF output, as there are still formatting issues, as evident in the image below.
